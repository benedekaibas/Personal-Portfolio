        I am a third-year international student-athlete at Allegheny College. Thanks to a school scholarship, I am able to continue my tennis career 
        and pursue my studies in the United States after my home country, Hungary. I have been interested in the world of computers and programming since 
        high school, which is why I chose computer science as my major. I have already completed small projects and internships, but I am eager to learn 
        new skills and expand my career in the field of computer science.
